# Introduction
Hi! Welcome to my analysis of the 2023 data job market, mostly focusing on the specific role of data analyst. The goal of this project is to better navigate the job market by examining in-demand skills, top-paying opportunities and projecting career paths to uncover the best opportunities for data analysts.

This is my first ever Python project as I'm learning how to program with Python. It allows me to walk through all the fundamentals and apply them while exploring real-world data analysis tasks. 

The data source is from [Python Lesson by Luke Barousse](https://www.lukebarousse.com/python), which sets the foundation for my analysis by providing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, essential skills, and even posted time. By using Python scripts, I investigate key questions, including the most demanded skills, salary trends, and how demand and salary interact within the data analytics field.

# Questions
## Here are some questions I have and want to answer while going through this dataset:
 1. What are the must-have skills for the top 3 trending data roles?
 2. How are the top skills trending for Data Analyst?
 3. How well do jobs and skills pay Data Analyst?
 4. What is the most optimal skill to learn for Data Analyst?
 5. What is the projected career path and salary for a Data Analyst?

df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda date: ast.literal_eval(date) if pd.notna(date) else date)
```

#### 4. Filter US Jobs
```python
df_us = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']
```
**This analysis project is mostly focusing on jobs in the US.*

# The Analysis

## 1. What are the key skills for the top 3 trending data roles?

### Thought Process 
To identify the top 3 most popular data roles, I filtered positions based on market demand, and then selected the top 5 skills associated with these roles. 
This query emphasizes the most popular job titles and their key skills, helping me identify which skills to focus on based on the role I'm aiming for.

### Visualizing Data
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_count[df_skills_count['job_title_short'] == title].head(5)
    df_plot[::-1].plot(kind='barh', x='job_skills', y='skill_count', ax=ax[i], title=title)
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].legend().set_visible(False)
    
fig.suptitle('Count of Top Skills in Top 3 trending Roles', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
### Results

ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

for i in range(5):
    y_position = df_us_da_plot.iloc[-1, i]
    
    if df_us_da_plot.columns[i] == 'python':
        y_position += 2
    elif df_us_da_plot.columns[i] == 'tableau':
        y_position -= 2 
    
    plt.text(
        11.2, y_position, 
        df_us_da_plot.columns[i], 
        va='center', 
        ha='left'
    )

```

## 3. How Well do jobs and salary pay for Data Analysts?

### Thought Process 
First, to spot the highest-paying roles, I analyzed the median salaries for positions like Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist, and identify which role has the highest pay.

Detailed steps click here to view:
[4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb](3_Project/4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

### Visualize Data

```python
sns.barplot(data=df_da_top_pay, x='median', y=df_da_top_pay.index, ax=ax[0], hue='median', palette='dark:salmon_r')

sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')

plt.show()

```

### Results

![Salary Distributions for Data Jobs in the US](3_Project/Images/top_6_roles_salary_scatter.png)
*Box Plot visualizes the distributions of salary for the top 6 data job titles*

### Takeaways
- Senior Data Scientists have the highest salary among all three senior roles, including the outliers.
- The annual salary range for Data Engineers and Data Scientists is higher than that of Senior Data Analysts, suggesting that the skills required for Engineers and Scientists could be more technical.
- Data Scientists not only have the broadest IQR but also the most extreme outliers (~600k).

## Analyzing Top-Paying Skills & Most Demanded Skills
Second, I focused on Data Analyst roles and examined the highest-paid skills, as well as the most in-demand skills, showcasing them with two separate bar charts.

### Visualize Data

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_us_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order = job_order_list)
plt.title('Salary Distribution in the United Stats')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary ($USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
ax = plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))
plt.xlim(0, 600000)
plt.show()
```

#### Results

![Top Paid Skills Vs, Top Demand Skills](3_Project/Images/top_pay_vs_top_demand.png)
*Box Plot visualizes the distributions of salary for the top paid skills and top demanded skills*

### Takeaways
- The top bar shows that specialized technical skills, such as dplyr, Bitbucket, and Gitlab, are correlated with higher salaries, with some reaching up to $200K. This suggests that advanced technical skills can enhance salary potential.
- The bottom bar illustrates that Python is the highest-paying skill among the top 10 most in-demand skills, making it the most valuable skill for Data Analysts.
- Microsoft skills, such as PowerPoint, Excel, and Word, appear at the bottom of the list, suggesting that while these skills are widespread, their value is diminished for Data Analysts.
- Thereâ€™s a clear difference between the highest-paying skills and the most in-demand ones. To boost career potential, Data Analysts should aim to build a diverse skill set that includes both high-paying specialized skills and widely recognized foundational skills.

## 4. What is the most Optimal skill to learn for Data Analyst?

### Thought Process 
To pinpoint the best skills for Data Analysts (those that are both the highest paid and most in demand), I calculated the demand percentage and median salary for each skill, making it easier to identify the most valuable skills to learn.

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
sns.scatterplot(
    data=df_plot, 
    x='skill_percent',
    y='median_salary',
    hue='technology'
)
plt.show()

```

#### Results

![Optimal Skills to Learn for Data Analysts in the US](3_Project/Images/optimal_skills_scatter.png)

*Scatter Plot visualizes the most optimal skills for data analysts in the US*

### Takeaways
Skill Analysis:
- `Python` offers a higher average salary (~98K) but is requested in only about 30% of Data Analyst job postings, indicating that while it can lead to better pay, itâ€™s not as frequently required.
- On the contrary, `SQL` has a slightly lower average salary (~91K) but dominates the demand, appearing in nearly 60% of Data Analyst job postings, emphasizing its critical role in securing a position in the field.
- Although the salary for `Oracle` is only slightly lower than Python, job postings request it in only approximately 5% of cases, highlighting the fact that specialized technical skills are highly valued for Data Analysts.

Technology Analysis
- The scatter plot reveals that most programming skills (in blue) cluster around the higher salary range, suggesting that programming can lead to better pay for Data Analysts.
- Analyst tools (in green), such as Tableau and Power BI, are commonly listed in job postings and come with competitive salaries. These tools are essential for todayâ€™s data roles, offering both versatility and value across a range of data-related tasks.
